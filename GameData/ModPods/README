Mod Pods
Currently built for KSP 1.3

This will be a pack of parts that will be basically adapters between sizes. Each part will go from Size N to size N+1 unless I make some double story units. Each unit will be 1.426m tall, so they match the slope of the Mark 1-2 pod (the bigger stock pod).

Each unit will eventually come in several varieties, crew quarters, Science lab, various tanks, including a service module with a variety of tankage plus built in RCS. I also intend a cargo variant for each size (most likely type to get double story editions).

Once I progress past a 3.75m base, I'll be adding heat shields as I go as well. The main idea being that this can be used to create arbitrarily large pods by stacking truncated cones. As such, I am very much aiming at Stock look and feel (aka stock-a-like).

This first release has the crew quarters and science lab with mostly complete outsides, and rough sketchy (and so far identical) insides. Plus a very quick run at monoprop and dual fuel tanks, all for the 2.5m to 3.75m size. There's no real point in working from the largest size up. :-)


Final size plan;

Size 2 to Size 3
from 2.5m to 3.75m

Size 3 to Size 4
from 3.75m to 5m

Size 4 to Size 5
from 5m to 6.25m

Size 5 to Size 6
from 6.25m to 7.5m

Size 6 to Size 7
from 7.5m to 8.75m

Size 7 to Size 8
from 8.75m to 10m

Size 8 to Size 9
from 10m to 11.25m

Size 9 to Size 10
from 11.25m to 12.5m

Size 10 to Size 11
from 12.5m to 13.75m

Size 11 to Size 12
from 13.75m to 15m

Size 12 to Size 13
from 15m to 16.25m

Size 13 to Size 14
from 16.25m to 17.5m

Size 14 to Size 15
from 17.5m to 18.75m

Size 15 to Size 16
from 18.75m to 20m

Each size should eventually get the following parts

Service Module
A combined fuel tank, battery pack, RCS, antenna unit

MonoPropellantTank
A fuel tank for monopropellant

BiPropellantTank
A fuel tank for liquid fuel and oxidizer

Crew Quarters and Control
A control pod with some extra seating

ScienceLab
A science lab with experiments and a science bay

Cargo
Stores things behind doors

HeatShield
Protects things from re-entry heat

Battery
- might not do this. If I do, I might modify the plan to just do a short cylindrical battery like the stock inline batteries for each size beyond stock -

Reactor
A reactor for electrical power

XenonTank
A fuel tank for Xenon gas

OreTank
A tank for storing crushed ore

SimpleAdapter
Hollow structural component for bridging part sizes

ShieldAeroSpike
Aerospike style engine using a heat shield as it's truncated spike
